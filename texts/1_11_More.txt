The horse can Count. Joe rides into town on his horse, Jolly. Today he wants to buy a lot of things for the winter. There is an old shop. It's Old Fred's shop. Old Fred has got everything. Joe thinks: "Jolly's strong. Jolly can carry a lot." And he sings a little song. Joe goes into the shop. Jolly waits outside and eats some hay. "Hi, Fred," Joe shouts. "How are you?" "I'm fine, Joe," Fred answers. "Good to see you. What can I do for you?" "Well, I want to buy a lot of things today." "Great," Fred says, "0K, so what would you like?" "Well, first I'd like 40 kilos of beans. Beans are my favourite food." "Right. Beans. 40 kilos. What else?" "Then I'd like 20 kilos of rice." "0K, rice is nice," Fred says, and he laughs. "And I'd like carrots for my rabbits. 30 kilos, please." "Sure," Fred says. "No problem. Anything else?" "Hmmm," Joe says, "let me think." Jolly is outside, and he listens to Joe and Fred. He thinks: "40 kilos of beans and 20 kilos of rice. That's 60 kilos. And 30 kilos of carrots ... hmm. That's 90 kilos!!" Then he hears Joe. "And I'd like 50 kilos of potatoes." "140 kilos!!!" Jolly thinks. "Joe can carry them — not me!" And he runs back home. Ten minutes later, Joe comes out of the shop. Jolly isn't there. "Hey, Jolly!" Joe shouts. "Come here!" But Jolly can't hear him. When Joe gets back to the farm, Jolly is under the big apple tree. "Five kilometres in five hours. Man, that's really slow!" Jolly thinks.  Joe a horse. Fred has got a shop.
