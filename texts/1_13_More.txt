What are you doing?
A knock at the window. She is alone in the house. She's watching TV. Suddenly, there is a knock at the window. Dana is at the window. It's dark outside. There's nothing in the garden. It's five minutes later. Dana's watching TV again — but there is a second knock at the window. Now she's scared! She phones her best friend Joe on his mobile. "Joe! It's Dana. I'm scared!" "Oh? What's the matter?" I'm at home, alone. I'm watching television. But there are noises in the garden. Can you come here, please?" "Sorry, I can't. Dad and I are cooking dinner. Bye, Dana!" Dana is angry. Joe is her best friend. Suddenly, there is a third knock at the window! Dana is really scared now. She phones Joe again. There's no answer. "What's that? I can hear a mobile phone. It's ringing— and it's in the garden!" Now Dana is at the window again, and she can see Joe outside! He's hiding in the bushes. He's looking at his mobile phone. Dana is alone in the house. Joe is cooking dinner with his mum. A mobile phone is ringing in the garden. She phones her Father after the first knock. She says that outside there are noises, People or animals. She can't see him. He is under the bushes, under the trees or in the bushes. Why is she phoning him? How does she feel when he says he can't come? Who can she see in the garden?

he answers his phone. Joe, it's me again. I'm so scared. Please come over. I'm really sorry, Dana, I can't. I'm helping my dad. Dana opens the door. She walks quietly towards the bush. But Joe. I'm really, really scared. Dana, are you there? Dana? Dana? Got you!
