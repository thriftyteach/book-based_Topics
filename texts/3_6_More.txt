Scene 1 Ana, Nick and Dan are on a school trip in the countryside. They are sitting around a late night campfire. Ana That's just silly. Of course it's not true. Nick Are you sure? Why don't you try it? Ana Because I don't want to. What do you think, Dan? Dan! Dan What ... What ... I'm sorry. I think I fell asleep for a few minutes. What are you talking about? Ana Nick says that if you look into a mirror and say "Candyman" three times, an evil spirit will appear in front of you. Nick Yes, and then he leaves the Mirror to come and ... GET YOU! Ana Stop it, Nick. It's not funny. Nick Did I make you jump? Dan Don't listen to him, Ana. He just wants to scare you. Nick Well, that's what people are supposed to do around campfires, Dan. Scare each other. Ana So it's not true. Dan Of course not. It's just a silly superstition like if you break a mirror, it brings you seven years' bad luck. Ana Or if you see a rainbow, you can make a wish. Dan Exactly. Those wishes never come true, do they? Nick They do if you wish for something bad, but no one ever does that. Dan Ignore him, Ana. He's just being silly. Scene 2 Mr Wallis, the teacher, arrives and sits down beside them. Mr Wallis Are you three still awake? Everyone else is already in bed. Nick Sorry, Mr Wallis. We're just telling some campfire stories. Mr Wallis Nothing too scary I hope. (laughing) I don't want any of you waking me up in the middle of the night with your screams. Ana Well, Nick is trying to scare me, but I know he's just being silly. Mr Wallis Good, because I want you three in your tents and fast asleep in ten minutes. We've got a big day tomorrow and I want everyone up and having breakfast by 7 a.m. OK, I'm really ready for bed anyway. I know you are. You Keep falling asleep. OK then. Goodnight and remember, be careful what you dream about. What do you mean? Well, you know what they say about your first night in a new bed. No, what do they say? They say that whatever you dream about comes true. Mr Wallis! You're worse than Nick. Scene 3 Nick is in his sleeping bag. He is dreaming. Ana Come on, Nick. Follow me. Nick Where are we going? Ana Don't you worry. Just come with me. Nick Wow, this house is really spooky. Who lives here? Ana Oh, no one special. Just a spirit by the name of Candyman. Nick I'm not scared. Ana Here we are - the bathroom. After you. Nick Dan, what are you doing here? Dan I'm waiting for you. Nick And Mr Wallis. Is that you? Mr Wallis Yes, it is, Nick. We're all here. So what are you waiting for? What do you mean? There's the mirror. Remember: three times. Nice and loud. Don't be silly. I'm not doing that. What's the matter? Are you scared? It's only a silly superstition, after all. Do it. Do it. Do it. Oh, alright. Candyman. Is that OK? And again. Candyman.  satisfied? And one more time. Really? Do I really have to do this? Mr Wallis Of course you do. Come on now. Nick CANDYMAN ! Scene 4 It's the next morning. Dan is sitting eating his breakfast. Ana joins him with a tray of food. Ana Hi, Dan, do you mind if I sit and join you? Dan Not at all. Have a seat. Ana So, did you sleep well? Dan I had a wonderful night's sleep. I really didn't want to get up when my alarm Clock rang. Ana Me too. I never knew sleeping in a tent could be so good. Dan It's all that fresh country air. Ana So did your dreams come true? Dan Did my dreams come true? I'm not sure what you mean. Ana Don't you remember, before we went to bed last night? Mr Wallis said that dreams in a new bed always come true. Dan Oh yes, I remember. Well, I guess he was right. Ana He was right? Dan Yes, I dreamed about eating a delicious bowl of porridge and here I am ... with a delicious bowl of porridge. Ana Ha, ha - very funny. Dan I'm not joking, Ana. I really did dream about eating breakfast. What about you? Ana Well, I don't really remember very much. I think I dreamed about Nick. He went missing and no one could find him. It was very strange. Dan Well, he's not here yet. Maybe your dream has come true. Spooky. Ana Stop it. I'm worried. Maybe we should go and look for him. Dan Oh alright. I'll go and look for him after breakfast, unless he comes here first, of course.  Scene 5 Dan and Ana meet outside the camp washrooms. Ana Any luck? Dan No. There's no sign of him anywhere. Ana I'm starting to get really worried. Dan Don't be silly. You know Nick. It's just one of his silly jokes. Ana But Mr Wallis wants us all ready to go in five minutes. Dan He'll be here. I promise you. if you' ll excuse me. Ana Where are you going? Dan In here. I'm just going to wash my face and brush my teeth.  Scene 6 Dan is in the washroom brushing his teeth.

The lucky charm. Tom Hey, Kate. Just the person I wanted to see. Kate Really? Lucky me. Tom The 1915 are playing in Brighton a week on Friday! Are you free? Kate Let me see, am I free? Of course I'm free! Tom So how about that? Do you want to go and see them? Kate I'd love to. I'll have to check with my mum and dad, but I'm sure they won't mind. How do you want to get there? Tom We could go by train. It's only half an hour away from here.
Kate Hmm ... possibly, but I'm not sure my dad will like that. He still  thinks I'm a little girl. Tom We could ask my mum. She'd take us. I'm
sure. Her best friend lives in Brighton so she could go and see her and  pick us up after the show. Kate That'd be great. Your mum is so cool.
Tom I know. She'll probably let me use her credit card to buy the tickets too. Kate I'll get my dad to give me some money to pay you back. So let me just put this in my diary. So Friday next week, you say. Tom That's right.
Kate Oh! Oh dear. Tom. I'm really sorry but I can't make it. Tom Have you got something else arranged? Kate No, I haven't. It's just that next Friday is the 13th! ... Friday the 13th' I can't travel anywhere. It's unlucky!
Tom You're joking, right. Kate I'm not. Sorry. Tom Wait. So, we're not going to see The 1915 because of a superstition. Kate I'm sorry. I'm superstitious. There's Nothing I can do about it.
