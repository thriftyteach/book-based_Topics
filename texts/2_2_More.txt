Pronto. SCENE 1 A show with Charles, a hypnotist, on stage. With him is his assistant Vivien. In front of them there are tables with people sitting at them. Charles And now, ladies and gentlemen, we need a man for a little experiment. What about you, sir? Roger No, thank you.  Claire Oh, come on, Roger. Maybe it’s fun. Please do it.  Roger Oh, alright. Come up here, sir. (Roger walks on stage. Applause.)What’s your name? Roger I’m Roger. Charles Please have a seat, Roger. I’m going to hypnotise  you. Look at this medal. I’m going to swing it.  You follow it with your eyes – that’s all. Roger And then? Charles And then I’m going to give you some commands. And you are going to do what I say. Claire Tell him to do the washing-up every day! Right, here we go. You only hear what I say. You only follow my commands. (He hypnotises Roger.)Good! Stand up! Stand on one leg. Hop around. Very good. Jump down to your friend. Kiss her hand. Very good. Come back here again. Give me your watch. Thank you, very good. When I say “Pronto” – you wake up again. You don’t remember anything, of course! One, two, three – “Pronto”. Roger What happened? What did you do? Did you hypnotise me? What did I do? Charles It’s alright. You gave me your watch. Roger I didn’t. (He checks.) I did. Give it back to me. Vivien Here you are, sir. Thank you, sir. Charles Applause for the gentleman. Applause. After the show, Charles and Vivien are alone. Vivien Did it work? Charles Of course it did. I gave Roger the secret commands. Vivien So, we’re going to be rich? Charles Very rich, baby, very rich. Vivien Do you think he can break into the museum? Charles Yes, he can. He’s very strong. Vivien Did you tell him to throw the jewels in the bushes? Charles I did. We pick up the jewels. The police pick up Roger. (They both laugh.) In a room of the museum. In the background there is a broken window. There is broken glass everywhere. Come on, Lewis. Tell me the facts. Sergeant Lewis Somebody broke into the museum, took the Deng Jewels and jumped out of the window. Inspector Lime Jumped out of the window? Why didn’t he use the door? Sergeant Lewis The alarm went off when he broke in and the security guards came. Inspector Lime I see. Any clues? Sergeant Lewis Yes, we found blood under the window, but no thief. Inspector Lime Ah, what have we got here? A wallet! Sergeant Lewis Don’t touch it, sir. Inspector Lime But my hands are clean! Sergeant Lewis I know, sir. But we need the fingerprints. The thief’s fingerprints. Not yours! Inspector Lime Ah, yes. Hm, hm. Sorry, errm. And just look at all the mess around here. Sergeant Lewis Don’t walk around in it, sir. Inspector Lime You’re right. My shoes are  getting dirty. Sergeant Lewis No, the footprints, sir. Inspector Lime Am I making footprints? Well, the museum people can clean them up. Sergeant Lewis Not your footprints, sir. The thief’s footprints.  I have to go now, sir.  See you at the station. Inspector Lime Yes, yes. Good man.  Off you go. Sergeant Lewis is at the door of Claire’s house. Sergeant Lewis I’m trying to find Mr Allen. I’ve got his wallet. This address was in it. Claire Oh yes, he’s my boyfriend. Sergeant Lewis I see. Can I talk to him? Claire Is it about the accident? He’s still in hospital. And he can’t remember what happened. Sergeant Lewis An accident? Tell me more about it. In a room at the hospital. Sergeant Lewis Sir, can you hear me? Claire He can’t hear you. Sergeant Lewis Sir, please, talk to me. It’s very important. (The door opens, and a doctor comes in.) Doctor What are you doing here? This man is in shock. Sergeant Lewis I’m from the police, sir. Doctor I don’t care. I want you out now. Pronto! Suddenly Roger sits up and starts walking stiffly towards the door.) Doctor Hey, what’s going on? Don’t get out of bed! Claire Goodness me, you said “Pronto”. That’s what the hypnotist said. Sergeant Lewis The hypnotist? Tell me more. In Inspector Lime’s office at the police Station. Look at the paper, Lewis! Sergeant Lewis Why, sir? Inspector Lime It says “Inspector Lime solves another case! Jewels back at the museum.”  Let me read it to you. Sergeant Lewis No, sir. Thank you, sir. Inspector Lime Alright. I like that. “Inspector Lime solves another case!” Where did you catch them, Lewis? The paper doesn’t say. Sergeant Lewis The hypnotist and his friend were already on a plane to Singapore. I phoned the police in Singapore this morning and they arrested them an hour ago. Inspector Lime Fantastic! We did an excellent job! (He takes the newspaper.)“Inspector Lime solves another case!” I like that!  Charles hypnotises D Roger.
